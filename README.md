# TaskTracker.b1
Managed to get the tracker working using on a local port however i could not get it to deploy with AWS due to the data being store on a local host file
I also need more experience using express to connect backend to front end so i could get my data to display in the html so i could only get it to display in the arry in the json file so far but not the html
